KICK 
SNARE 
OVERHEAD
BASS 
GUITARS 
VOCALS 

ASOUND & LIGHTING
We prefer an overall natural sound with minimal processing and effects. The
drums need not have clicky attack sound, please use gates only when
unavoidable and with great care. The vocals are best left without reverberation,
maybe a bit of the female singer. The male singer has a very large dynamic
range, please use compression. Lighting can be discussed during the
soundcheck, it is important though that during the show there is always a
sufficient light fort he bass and guitar players to see the fretboard of their
instrument. If avaiable please use special effects like stroboskop or fog.

EQUIPMENT SHARING & SOUNDCHECK

The drummer always plays his own drumset and will not share his drums with
the other bands, except. Festivals. Apart from that we might share one of our
guitar cabinets (4x12“), but this needs to be discussed well before the show. We
will need an absolute minimum of 45 minutes soundcheck, 60 to 90 minutes
including the setup would be perfect.

before the date of the show with the complete adress of the venue and a
